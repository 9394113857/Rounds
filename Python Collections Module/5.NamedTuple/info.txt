NamedTuple:-
A NamedTuple returns a tuple object with names for each position, which the ordinary tuples lack.
For example, consider a tuple names student
1.where the first element represents fname, second represents lname and the third element represents the DOB.
2.Suppose for calling fname instead of remembering the index position
you can actually call the element by using the fname argument,
then it will be really easy for accessing tuples element.
3.This functionality is provided by the NamedTuple.

Syntax:
class collections.namedtuple(typename, field_names)
