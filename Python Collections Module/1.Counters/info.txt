Counters:-
A counter is a sub-class of the dictionary. It is used to keep the count of the elements in an iterable in the form of an unordered dictionary where the key represents the element in the iterable and value represents the count of that element in the iterable.

Note: It is equivalent to bag or multiset of other languages.

Syntax:
class collections.Counter([iterable-or-mapping])

Initializing Counter Objects:-
The counter object can be initialized using the counter() function
and this function can be called in one of the following ways:

-> With a sequence of items
-> With a dictionary containing keys and counts
-> With keyword arguments mapping string names to counts
