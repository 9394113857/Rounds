OrderedDict:-
An OrderedDict is also a sub-class of dictionary but unlike dictionary,
it remembers the order in which the keys were inserted.

Syntax:
class collections.OrderDict()

=======================================================================

While deleting and re-inserting the same key will push the key to the last
to maintain the order of insertion of the key.
